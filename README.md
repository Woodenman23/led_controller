This is an app to communicate verbally with an LLM.

The response will be visualised using an LED matrix.


The program sends a specialised prompt to Open Ai
via the api from captured audio from a user. It then
processes the response and converts it back into audio
which is played back to the user.

The next stage is to visualise the response using an 
LED matrix driven by a raspberry pi.
